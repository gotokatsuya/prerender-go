# prerender-go

Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Bing are constantly trying to view your website... but Google is the only crawler that executes a meaningful amount of JavaScript and Google even admits that they can execute JavaScript weeks after actually crawling. Prerender allows you to serve the full HTML of your website back to Google and other crawlers so that they don't have to execute any JavaScript. [Google recommends using Prerender.io](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering) to prevent indexation issues on sites with large amounts of JavaScript.
